    " 1. **Configure the deck layout**\n",
    " \n",
    "  a. The deck can be a combination of containers and tip racks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b. For each deck component, assign a variable name, e.g., `tiprack300` and assign a label, e.g., `label = tiprack`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  c. OT-2 recognises the format of each deck component by accessing the JSON files. A full list of available firmware JSON files can be found on [AdReNa's GitHub account](https://github.com/AdReNa-lab/OT2/tree/main/Labware/JSON%20files).\n",

    "  \n",
    "  `protocol.load_labware('adrena_tiprack_300ul_8row_12column',...)`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  e. Update the location of the deck components by using the [template](#a.-OT-2-deck-layout).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  f. **To add new containers/consumables please [contact the Developers](mailto:dev-ops@vesynta.com).**\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    " 2. **Select the pipettes used**\n",
    " \n",
    "  a. Select from the available pipettes - `p50`, `p300`, and `p1000` - representing $50 \\mu L$, $300 \\mu L$, and $1000 \\mu L$ pipettes respectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b. The pipettes that are not used can be commented out by using '#' symbol at the beginning of the line.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  c. The uncertainties measured for each pipette can be set by calling the corresponding `calcunc.call_pipette_error_to_vu()` function - for e.g.,\n",

    "  `bb.set_pipette_uncertainties(p300, calcunc.call_p300_error_to_vu())`\n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 4. **Assign unique variables to specific wells of interest for direct access into the well**\n",
    " \n",
    "  a. For e.g., to locate the container with water in location A1 : `tip_water = tiprack300['A1']`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b. Now, this container can be directly accessed by the OT2 just by calling the variable `tip_water`.\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    " 5. **Set the headroom of non-empty containers in the deck**\n",
    " \n",
    "  a. The names of the containers must have been declared using the step above. For e.g., `solvent = tuberack_falc50['A1']` followed by `bb.set_headroom(solvent, 10)` to set a headroom of 10 mm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b. Then initiate the concentrations and associated uncertainties for stock solutions by calling the stock's specific label. For e.g., to set the concentrations of Dox -\n",

    "  for a concentration of 15000 $ng/mL$ and an uncertainty of 150 $ng/mL$.\n",
