### General practice for contributions

Please:

- Make sure that the 'main' branch remains **fully functional**.
  - This means, work in a branch if your contributions are not yet ready to be properly implemented.
- Close branches when possible (i.e. work in functional increments).
- Commit regularly, with clear descriptions.
