### General practice for contributions

Please:

- Make sure that the 'main' branch remains **fully functional**.
  - This means, work in a branch if your contributions are not yet ready to be implemented by an end-user.
- Close branches when possible (i.e. work in functional increments).
- Commit regularly, with clear descriptions.

- Where possible, name your commit using <u>semantic version numbering: "vXX.YY.ZZ"</u>
  - ZZ is a 'patch' (a bug fix)
  - YY is a 'minor' version (an additional feature that *is* backward compatible with previous code)
  - XX is a 'major' version (which may breaks things in previous scripts)
