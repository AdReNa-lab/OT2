    "    * Begun to implement multi-line function info at top\n",
    "* Added `check_well_attributes()` function to check the instance attributes have been correctly set for wells in which the meniscus is tracked. This is used by custom functions (where necessary) to avoid potential inconsitencies in type-checking.\n",

    "* Modified `custom_transfer_forward()` to prevent air gaps from affecting the headroom. \n",
    "* Added security check in `custom_aspirate()`, `custom_mixing_bottom_to_top()` and `custom_mixing_static()` functions to avoid going deeper in a container than the height of the pipette tip, added argument tip_length to this effect\n",
    "* Uniformization: all \"depth\" variables are now defined as positive numbers in all functions, changed in: `custom_touch_tip`\n",
    "* Overhaul of `Measured gradations`:\n",
    "    * Naming convention established: tube-type_volume_vh for a vh function\n",
    "    * Gradation arrays have been added for the following labware: 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes; 15 mL and 50 mL Falcon tubes; 2 mL, 4 mL, 8 mL, 20 mL and 30 mL vials; 70 uL cuvettes \n",
    "    * Information header updated\n",
    "    * Instructions added for `well.volume_headroom_functions` in the main protocol\n",

    "* Implementation of testing on-robot for:\n",
    "    * Custom labware positioning\n",
    "    * All custom functions\n",
    "* Added pipette.move_to(source.top()) to `custom_transfer_forward()` to prevent `custom_touch_tip()` from going in direct line from the destination to the source (i.e. avoid collisions on the path)\n",
    "* Most `move_to()` commands related to aspirate/dispense functions commented out and positions included in related function: reasoning is that move_to tend to cause double mouvements - e.g. the pipette moves in the desired position, then goes back to the top of the position and down again when a function is used\n",
    "* Added `custom_tlc_spotting()` function with testing in main \n",
    "* Suggestion: consider writing down updated headrooms in a separate or updatable file - improved tracing, prevents constant headroom measurements in the case of sequential experiments\n",

    "_Comitted by:_ Yann Mamie <y.mamie@ucl.ac.uk>:<br>\n",
    "_Commit date:_ 2020-10-14<br>\n",

    "_Comitted by:_ Yann Mamie <y.mamie@ucl.ac.uk>:<br>\n",
    "_Commit date:_ 2020-10-16<br>\n",
    "* Added the option to touch tip at the destination when using `custom_transfer_forward()` and `custom_transfer_reverse()`\n",
    "    * Idea: last drop is often not effectively blown out, this can represent the majority of the transfer volume in the case of small transfers\n",
    "* Moved air gap aspiration before liquid aspiration for `custom_transfer_forward()`\n",
    "    * Idea: air is now above the liquid in the pipette and helps pushing out all of the liquid\n",
    "* Movement up (in z-axis) added at the end of `custom_touch_tip()`\n",
    "    * Idea: under some conditions, the next move after a touch tip will use the direct path instead of going back up at a security distance, this extra step adds security in this scenario\n",
    "* Modified graduation definition of 70 ul cuvettes to allow filling to the mark\n",
    "* Overflow security check for destination moved from `custom_dispense()` to `custom_transfer_forward()` and `custom_transfer_reverse()`\n",
    "    * Idea: previously, the protocol would stop after aspirating and before dispensing, it now stops before starting the transfer\n",

    "_Comitted by:_ Yann Mamie <y.mamie@ucl.ac.uk>:<br>\n",
    "_Commit date:_ 2020-11-02<br>\n",
    "* Added a \"move_to(well)\" command at the start of `custom_touch_tip()`\n",
    "    * Idea: if a different well than the current location was specified for a touch tip, the function would use direct movement to the new well (thus crashing the tip)\n",
    "* Added arguments to `custom_touch_tip()`\n",
    "    * `radius_position` allows modification of the radial coordinate of the touch tip, i.e. allowing gentler touch\n",
    "    * `speed` allows setting of the movement speed during touch tip\n",
    "* Modified warning message in `custom_mixing_static()` and `custom_mixing_bottom_to_top()` to include location\n",

    "_Comitted by:_ Yann Mamie <y.mamie@ucl.ac.uk>:<br>\n",
    "_Commit date:_ 2020-11-25<br>\n",
    "* Added a `custom_mixing_top_to_bottom()` function for use on conical containers\n",
    "* Default flow rates modified for `custom_aspirate()` and `custom_dispense()`\n",
    "* Addition of `aspirate_rate` and `dispense_rate` parameters to all custom mixing and transfer functions, with default values\n",
    "* Overhaul of `calibration()` function to allow more flexibility\n",
    "* Modified or added gradations definitions according to CAD files measurements for the following labware: Eppendorf tubes 1.5 ml, 5 mL, 15 mL and 50 mL"
